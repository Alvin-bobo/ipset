Installation instructions
=========================

The ipset library is written in ANSI C.  It uses Waf as its build
manager.


Prerequisite libraries
----------------------

To build ipset, you need the following libraries installed on your
system:

  * pkg-config
  * glib-2.0
  * check (http://check.sourceforge.net)


Building from source
--------------------

The ipset library uses Waf as its build manager.  In most cases, you
should be able to build the source code using the following:

    $ ./waf configure --prefix=$PREFIX
    $ ./waf -p
    $ ./waf -p build_tests
    $ ./waf test
    $ ./waf install

You might have to run the last command using sudo, if you need
administrative privileges to write to the $PREFIX directory.
